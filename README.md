**Conclusion**

We can make the following conclusion from the experimental results and analysis:
1. 	Bernoulli Naïve Bayes perform well in predicting the authenticity of customer reviews using bool vectors as an input with an accuracy of 57%. The model exceeds the baseline accuracy of 50%.
1. 	Multinomial Naïve Bayes perform better in predicting customer reviews sentiment using count vectors as input with an accuracy of 81%. This exceeds the baseline accuracy of 50%.
1. 	Sentiment classification attained more accuracy using machine learning classifier compared to authenticity classification.
